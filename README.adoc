= jradius-client library

This is the jradius-client library. It is distributed under the LGPL (see the LICENSE file which should be included with this package).

Usage:
You can run the test client from the command line as follows

[source, bash]
----
java --classpath=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/jradius-client.jar \
    net.sourceforge.jradiusclient.TestRadiusClient \
    -s hostname \
    --auth-port 8190 \
    --acct-port 8191 \
    -S shared-secret 
----

where 

- hostname is the name of the host running the Radius Server
- authport is the port the authentication part of the RADIUS Server is running on 
- acctport is the port the accounting part of the Radius server is running on
- shared-secret is, of course the secret you share with the Radius server
- username and password had better be self-explanatory (question using execution)

Additionally you will need to be sure that java gnu getopt jar is in your classpath.
